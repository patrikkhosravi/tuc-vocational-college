# Home WiFi Network Optimization & Security Hardening

**Course**: Nätverksteknik  
**Credits**: 25 YH-credits  
**Institution**: TUC Yrkeshögskola  
**Completed**: September 2024  
**Grade**: highest grade VG (Väl Godkänd)

## Assignment Objective

Analyze home WiFi network performance using professional radio planning tools, implement systematic optimization strategies, and measure performance improvements. Assignment required before/after documentation with quantitative metrics demonstrating optimization effectiveness across multiple test locations.

## Methodology

### Tools Used

**Ekahau Heatmapper**: Professional-grade signal strength mapping tool providing visual dBm coverage analysis  
**Ping Testing**: Latency and packet loss measurement (50-packet samples to Google DNS 8.8.8.8)  
**Bredbandskollen.se**: Swedish ISP-neutral bandwidth testing service  
**Router Configuration Interface**: Direct CLI/web access for protocol and channel management

### Test Environment

Three strategically selected measurement locations representing different RF propagation challenges:

1. **Living room corner**: Optimal line-of-sight to router (baseline best-case)
2. **Kitchen**: Wall obstruction between router and test point (real-world interference)
3. **Bathroom**: Maximum distance with multiple structural obstacles (worst-case scenario)

Each location tested three times at each measurement point to ensure statistical validity.

## Optimization Strategy

### Physical Optimization (Primary Impact Factor)

**Router Repositioning**:
- Elevated router 1 meter higher (positioned above bookshelf)
- Improved line-of-sight propagation to all test locations
- Reduced ground-level interference and obstruction

**Antenna Reconfiguration**:
- **Before**: 1 vertical + 2 horizontal antennas
- **After**: 2 vertical + 1 diagonal antennas
- **Rationale**: Improved signal polarization diversity matching typical client device antenna orientations (laptops, phones)

### 5 GHz Network Configuration Optimization

**Protocol Efficiency**:
- **Before**: 802.11ac/a/n mixed mode (backward compatibility enabled)
- **After**: 802.11ac only (single protocol)
- **Rationale**: Eliminated mixed-mode overhead, airtime fairness delays, and protection mechanisms for legacy devices. No 802.11a/n devices present on network.

**Channel Management**:
- **Before**: Auto channel selection
- **After**: Locked to specific channel after interference testing
- **Channel Width**: Auto → 40 MHz (low interference environment supports wider channels for increased throughput)

**Performance Impact**:
- Negotiated link speed: 325/325 Mbps → **433/433 Mbps** (+33% improvement)

### Security Hardening Measures

**Attack Surface Reduction**:
- **WPS (WiFi Protected Setup)**: Disabled to eliminate PIN brute-force vulnerability (known security weakness)
- **SIP ALG (Application Layer Gateway)**: Disabled to prevent VoIP protocol interference
- **IGMP Proxy**: Disabled (not required for current network topology)

**Quality of Service (QoS) Configuration**:
- Disabled NAT Boost feature to enable proper traffic prioritization
- Configured high-priority QoS queue for gaming device (latency-sensitive traffic)
- Static IP + MAC ad
